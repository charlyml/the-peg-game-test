# The Peg Game

This was a really fun challenge, I had to brush up my DSA skills to implement a DFS algorithm.

I got inspiration from [this post](https://www.jakepusateri.com/blog/peg-game-python/), where I added a bit more context to understand every movement, the solve method is the one I'm using to get the list of movement a user can do, it's a Depth First Search algorithm that evaluates every set of steps (from, over, to)

## Usage

To run the project use the following command

```bash
docker-compose up --build
```

And go to [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000)

## Running Tests

To run tests, go to the peg-game-front folder and run the following command

```bash
  npm run test
```

## Features

- Play the game by moving each Peg
- Get help by getting the list of movements
