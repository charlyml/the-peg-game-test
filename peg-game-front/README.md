# Frontend

I decided to use a frontend app to interact with the algorithm, the UI and the styles were created by the AI since I did't want too spend to much time styling and managing states

## Running Tests

To run tests, go to the peg-game-front folder and run the following command

```bash
  npm run test
```

## Improvements

This is a basic React app, my main goal is to show you how to interact with the algorithm and not show off my frontend skills. However, I would like to list what I would improve if this were code for a production environment.

- Router
- React Query to call a backend
- Composition and compound components to avoid Prop Drilling
- End-to-end tests using Cypress or Playwright
- Global state manager(Redux, Zuztand, or even just React context with a dispatcher)
- A CSS framework like Tailwind
